    <h1>What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h1>
    <p>AI is like teaching a computer to think, learn, and solve problems,<br> 
      just like a human would. It's the magic behind things like voice assistants, <br>
      self-driving cars, and even robots that can speak different languages.<br>
       AI learns from data, gets smarter over time, and helps us 
       make decisions faster and more accurately.<br> AI is transforming industries and daily life,
       making it one of the most exciting fields to explore today.<br>

    <h2>AI application in building Tianah</h2>
    <!-- Placeholder image of Tianah -->
    <img src="tianarobot.jpg" alt="Tianah Robot" class="tiana">
    <p>.AI was used to build Tianah by integrating natural language processing and speech recognition,<br> 
      enabling her to understand and speak both French and English.<br> 
      Machine learning models help her generate accurate responses,<br>
       while speech synthesis allows her to converse fluently in both languages.<br>
       Students are still working on local language integration with Tianah</p>
