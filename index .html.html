    <h2>how it works</h2>
    <p>
        The robotics wheelchair's control<br>
         system makes use of the Arduino<br> microcontroller and HC-05 <br>Bluetooth module, <br>
        which are connected via bluetooth to smartphone app called BT car. <br>
        The Arduino interprets the control signals<br> sent by the user through<br> the app,which include stopping,going left, right and forward. <br>
        The fundamental algorithm interprets<br> the instruction from bluetooth module<br> and sets the proper motors to run <br>at predetermined rates <br>
        The wheel chairs motors change<br> direction and speed in response to input, which include<br> forward, backward,left and right.

<h2>Project output</h2>
<p>
    
The outcome of the project ia a <br> functioning robotic wheelchair that<br> can be controlled wirelessly via<br> a smartphone. <br>
The wheel chair responds to user input<br> sent through the BT Car app, <br>allowing the user to navigate the<br> wheel chair in all directions <br>
It offers precise control,allowing<br> users to move easily in tight spaces<br> and achieve smoother, more<br> flexibility. <br>
The system is also cost effective<br>, using readily available components.

<h1>RAPID RESCUE ROBOT USING RASPBERRY PI</h1>
<h2>how it works</h2>
<p>
   The rapid rescue robot enables<br> rescue crews to remotely control<br> and survey the sorroundings. It is made for speedy<br> deployments in <br>
   disaster regions.The operator<br> connects to a hotspot, uses puTTY to contact<br> the robot, and then copies the IP adress of<br> the robot into <br>
   the browser<br> to initiate a control interfaces. <br>The operator can see a live video feed back from robots <br>camera and control its movements <br>
   with this interface. <br>Like a radar, the robot scans its environment <br>with its ultrasonic sensors to <br>find gaps and obstructions among the <br>
   debris. Real time<br> data visualisation aids<br> rescue crew in pinpointing<br> vital locations where the <br>possible survivors may be found <br>
   After that, the robots operator can direct<br> it to specific spots, greatly reducing the<br> search area and enabling rescuers to concetrate  <br>
   their efforts.
