         <p>On 23/03/2024 there was a virtual reality experience at the
             exhibition at UCU. <br>
            On the 14/05/2024 there was a display of robotic wheel chair.
            In addition they staged a display of the rapid reserve Robot.</br>

            In UCU the robotics chapter has evolved from a
           variety of robots starting with the robotic wheel chair
           to the Reserve robot now to the one called "Tiana".Tiana was once a project but now a humanoid robot
           powered by high voltage bus servos aluminium 
           alloy brackets and HD wide angle cameras.
           Tiana welcomes and greets guests at the 
           department of computing Tianah can run play soccer sing and sort things.
           Tianah can also speak a variety of languages like English, Spanish and French. </p>
       <p> The students in the robotics chapter are working 
           hard to train Tiana all local languages with time.
