    <h1>Robotics wheel controlled via bluetooth</h1>
    <img src="wheelchr.jpg">
    <h2>how it works</h2>
    <p>
        The robotics wheelchair's control system makes use of the Arduino microcontroller and HC-05 Bluetooth module, <br>
        which are connected via bluetooth to smartphone app called BT car. <br>
        The Arduino interprets the control signals sent by the user through the app,which include stopping,going left, right and forward. <br>
        The fundamental algorithm interprets the instruction from bluetooth module and sets the proper motors to run at predetermined rates <br>
        The wheel chairs motors change direction and speed in response to input, which include forward, backward,left and right.
    </p>

    

<h2>Project output</h2>
<p>
    
The outcome of the project ia a functioning robotic wheelchair that can be controlled wirelessly via a smartphone. <br>
The wheel chair responds to user input sent through the BT Car app, allowing the user to navigate the wheel chair in all directions <br>
It offers precise control,allowing users to move easily in tight spaces and achieve smoother, more flexibility. <br>
The system is also cost effective, using readily available components.

<h1>RAPID RESCUE ROBOT USING RASPBERRY PI</h1>
<img src="./images/rescue r.jpg">
<h2>how it works</h2>
<p>
   The rapid rescue robot enables rescue crews to remotely control and survey the sorroundings. It is made for speedy deployments in <br>
   disaster regions.The operator connects to a hotspot, uses puTTY to contact the robot, and then copies the IP adress of the robot into <br>
   the browser to initiate a control interfaces. The operator can see a live video feed back from robots camera and control its movements <br>
   with this interface. Like a radar, the robot scans its environment with its ultrasonic sensors to find gaps and obstructions among the <br>
   debris. Real time data visualisation aids rescue crew in pinpointing vital locations where the possible survivors may be found <br>
   After that, the robots operator can direct it to specific spots, greatly reducing the search area and enabling rescuers to concetrate  <br>
   their efforts.
</p>
<h2>project output</h2>
<p>
    When the quick rescue robot is deployed, it produces the following results<br>
    Remote control interface <br>
    Live video feed <br>
    Human detection <br>
    Real time decision support
</p>
<h2>Applications</h2>
Fire and emergency services <br>
Hazardous area exploitation <br>
Disaster response and sketch and rescue
